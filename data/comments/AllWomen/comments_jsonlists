That\u2019s a set back of $48 annually and $1920 over her entire menstruation\u2013 even more if she has a heavier flow.\n\nThe American College of Obstetrics estimates two-thirds of low-income women don\u2019t have enough money to buy menstrual products at least one time per year. It is also an impediment to education: a study by Always found that one in five girls have missed school due to a lack of period protection.\n\nFinancial status aside, we\u2019re all getting penalized for having our periods. Products that count as a medical expense are exempt from sales tax, like band-aids, walkers, sunscreen\u2013 even Viagra gets a tax break in every state besides Illinois. Yet menstrual products are only currently tax-free in 15 states; five of those states don\u2019t even have sales tax in general. Many period equity advocates have pressed on why tampons and sanitary napkins are taxed since menstruating is a biological function.\n\nI'm a producer for Empowered Health, a podcast focused on navigating women's health, we just released an episode all about period poverty, menstrual equity, and the tampon tax.\n\nWe talk with Nadya Okamoto of PERIOD. The Menstrual Movement and Kate Sanetra-Butler of Dignity Matters, two leaders working to end period poverty, who break down why it should be a right to health for every woman to have access to menstrual products. Sanetra-Butler\u2019s organization is on a mission to get menstrual products into all the schools, shelters, clinics, and whenever needed in Massachusetts, currently supporting over 2,500 women and girls every month. PERIOD. mobilizes college and high school students to advocate for period equity in over 400 chapters nationwide. Colorado Rep. Leslie Herod fills us in what it\u2019s like to get your period in prison and the bill she sponsored to better those conditions.\n\nBetween teenagers missing class due to a lack of menstrual products, incarcerated females trading sex for a tampon, and 35 states of women taxed for their femininity, there is a real need to address how our country views menstruation. Figured this group might be interested in what they has to say surrounding the topic, links to listen:\n\n[APPLE PODCASTS](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ep-12-american-women-are-punished-held-back-for-having/id1452440833?i=1000441043721#) | [SPOTIFY](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3f2HbQMiFlQRUAloERzMqp) | [GOOGLE PLAY](https://play.google.com/music/m/Dlxrutsp46u74id46fvauzbjzna?t=Ep_12_American_women_are_punished_and_held_back_for_having_their_periods-Empowered_Health) | [STITCHER](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/empowered-health/e/61805490?autoplay=true) | [LUMINARY](https://luminarypodcasts.com/listen/emily-kumler-469/empowered-health/ep-12-american-women-are-punished-and-held-back-for-having-their-periods/3941a5af-f0b4-47dc-9d41-9594657f7d6b) | [OVERCAST](https://overcast.fm/+QuxlevyXQ) | [WEBSITE](https://empoweredhealthshow.com/ep-12-punished-for/)", "created_utc": 1562942736, "gildings": {}, "id": "etlq1fe", "is_submitter": true, "link_id": "t3_ccbosg", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_ccbosg", "permalink": "/r/AllWomen/comments/ccbosg/which_states_are_taxing_you_for_getting_your/etlq1fe/", "retrieved_on": 1562942738, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "AllWomen", "subreddit_id": "t5_3983i", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1563029132, "created": 1562964336.0}

That's a really tough road to travel. Let's see if we can help you unpack and sort through some of it, okay?\n\n1.) I don't think there can be a realistic expectation or odds of being assaulted/meeting a terrible person. We're operating on the individual level here, not stepping back and looking at a whole population. It could be that there are more shitbags who are willing to hurt other people to get what they want in your area than is typical or something, so averages aren't very helpful. Odds don't factor in the characteristics of the predators, either\u2014some are really good at hiding in plain sight. The best I could give you is anecdotal evidence based on my own experience, and that's incredibly not-useful. \n\n2.) I understand what it's like to feel like you can't discuss something as serious as a sexual assault with the people around you, so the first thing I want you to know is that it's okay. You don't have an obligation to. \n\nI think that if your closest friend is always very supportive of you and if you love and trust each other a lot, she wouldn't be like, \"Shit, you think *that's* bad? I'll tell you what bad is!\" or anything. The pain of her own experience is a different issue, though. I know that I would walk through the fires of a thousand hells for some of my friends, but I wouldn't want to put them through that for me. How has she been doing since her assault? Would you be okay with asking her if she would be willing to lend an ear for this before discussing what happened to you and giving her a few days to decide, and time to prepare herself for it if she says yes?\n\nAs for your other friends, consider how much you trust them to listen, empathize, not tell you it was your fault, and basically just treat you well. In my mind, that should be your deciding factor. People have good times and bad times; good friends understand that and they want to help you through your bad times as much as they want to be with you to celebrate good times. If you're not sure you can count on them the way you need to, it's okay to decide not to bring this up right now.\n\nHave you considered contacting a crisis warmline/help line? In a way, that's what this thread is like, except calling an actual crisis line puts you in touch with people who have definitely been through training; you're less likely to get that here. I can try my best to be helpful, but I still haven't been taught how to help someone in a way that's most likely to be useful\u2014it would be easy for me to miss laying out some options that exist because I just don't know about them.\n\nLastly, your sexual preferences are *yours* and you have a right to them. People giving you shit about it is like feminists who talk bad about women who choose to be housewives. It's not right for them to try to make your choices for you; feminism and sex-positivism are about encouraging and increasing choice, not dictating a path that happens to be different from more conservative options. We're supposed to be more accepting, not just a different kind of hypocritical fascist. (I'm pretty sick of that shit, can you tell?)\n\nAs for your psychiatrist being judgmental/having a block about your abstinence, you might ask him if his opinion would change if you engaged in your chosen sex acts because those were the only ones you enjoyed. If his attitude would be different, it sounds more like his problem than yours\u2014nothing would change about the kinds of sex you were having except for his judgment of it. \n\nAnyhow, if none of these options work out for you, or if I've missed addressing something, please don't hesitate to shoot me a PM to unload. Sometimes it's easier to talk with someone you're not invested in, and one you know you won't encounter irl. &lt;3", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1487991454, "distinguished": null, "gilded": 0, "id": "de6o8oh", "link_id": "t3_5vssly", "nest_level": 1, "parent_id": "t3_5vssly", "reply_delay": 110421, "retrieved_on": 1489124081, "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "AllWomen", "subreddit_id": "t5_3983i", "created": 1488013054.0}

It's totally unacceptable to stereotype lots of different types of people whether or not the characteristics are visible (like racial groups, those with visible or non-visible disabilities, people suffering from mental health issues, financial status, etc.)\u2014and we should extend that treatment to all people, even those we might look at and immediately think, \"Heh... neckbeard\" about. Yes, they could easily change their appearances to avoid the stereotype, but should they need to do that just to have someone else *not* assume they're dweebs? Part of me is like, \"No, that's my baggage, not theirs. I would never say that someone who looks like a man couldn't actually be a trans woman, and I shouldn't assume that everyone who has gross facial hair is a neckbeard,\" and part of me is still like, \"Right. ...But white-knighting, Cheeto-dust-licking, fedora-tipping neckbeards!\" I think that regardless of where I eventually come down on this, it was good for me to get the reminder that even though there are still groups of people that it's socially acceptable to discriminate against, to do so is unfair.

But if you are religious, being religious isn't necessarily a choice, if that makes sense - I believe that God exists, that Jesus is his son etc etc, and I can't unbelieve it because I don't like certain parts of it. But what I can do is work with the church to make it a better place - my mother is like me, a Christian and a feminist, and she holds leadership role in her church. So she works to make it better, and I want to do the same. The church isn't going to go away for a long time, but it can change. \n\nAlso, consider posting this to /r/Christianity - you'll get a broad range of views, from ex-Christians and people with very different impressions of the church to me!

In spite of that, even in Orthodox Judaism, women hold an important and revered role, and some of that creates tons of the stereotypes everyone is used to... Overbearing Jewish mother, \"bitchy\" \"pushy\" \"rude\" women, emasculated men, yadayadayada. \n\nMy Mom was a feminist, we are reform, reform/conservative, and she always emphasized the story of Queen Esther, the fact that Judaism is a matriarchy (obviously hijacked by men through the millennia) and that your Jewish heritage is passed down through your mother. \n\nJewish homes and families have a reputation of being notoriously open about sex and sexuality, my moms joke about that was that in Jewish law, the sexual needs of the wife are the primary obligation of the husband... literally their number one duty, and when a Jewish woman doesn't get what she wants everyone will hear about it. \n\nThere is another philosophy that explains that the reason that women are not required to study Torah the way that men are is because women are inherently closer to G-d, and don't need to waste their time doing something that happens just by breathing. (That always stuck with me.)\n\nAlmost every Jewish woman I know will say that her three favorite women in the Torah are Queen Esther, Sarah, and Lilith. (I have heard rumors that there are Jewish scholars that argue that there is actually ANOTHER woman other than Lilith but before Eve that was 'created' in the Genesis story... but I digress.) \n\nI've always felt that the Judaism that I grew up in was an environment that seeded and encouraged my curiosity and self-esteem. I was never left searching for strong, powerful, female role-models and I never felt that my sex was a detriment. Also, I was never hungry because we can't stop cooking and I was never without anxiety because I have no idea how to stop worrying.

Traditionally this obligation is placed on parents, which in my opinion provides the one tiny shred of moral support behind heteronormativity: it makes things less confusing and shame easier to assign.  Shame is a vicious weapon, but child abandonment is a horrible beast.\n\nIn my opinion heterosexist culture has lost touch with even this *most basic* purpose for its existence.  Are children provided for?  Well, how much time can children choose to spend with their parents?  Are they farmed out to professional caregivers?  Do they live in a society full of adults they can trust and learn from?  Or strangers that they are taught to fear?  If marriage is intended to create stable homes, what is the divorce rate?  Are they more likely to be assaulted by parents or by strangers?\n\nIf abortion is morally wrong then people who can become pregnant still deserve a *lot* more respect.  The undercurrent of your questioning is that you feel the sexual needs of men are not being adequately met.  \n\nWhat about children's need to be nurtured?", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1443010231, "distinguished": null, "gilded": 0, "id": "cvb8xto", "link_id": "t3_3m1i0x", "nest_level": 1, "parent_id": "t3_3m1i0x", "reply_delay": 15499, "retrieved_on": 1444531413, "score": 1, "subreddit": "AllWomen", "subreddit_id": "t5_3983i", "created": 1443031831.0}

When I was in high school I got _super_ into Ayn Rand, and I'm pretty glad to be out of that phase. I think the year before (or after? who even knows) I was _super_ into communism. And then at some point I was _super_ into 1 Corinthians 6:9-11, and I feel pretty bad about being a Bible-thumping jerk to my classmates who were also trying to figure out themselves and the world.\n\nHaving grown up (a bit) since high school, most feminists I know are in their 20s or 30s or 40s, and without fail, they're all personable people with well-considered opinions about the world informed by plenty of actual experience with the world and the people in the world. (So, too, are all the libertarians, communists, and evangelicals I know, as it happens.) Probably about half of them are men. Those who are women always have good friends who are straight men, and a number of them are in long-term relationships with men.\n\nSo, unsurprisingly, they tend to be on the side of equality (equality through empowering women, as /u/peep295 pointed out), and not on the side of vilifying men as an end goal -- just as the grown-up communists don't have vilifying everyone with money as an end goal, etc.\n\nRe rape, not many of them have read Dworkin, but those that have tell me there's a lot more context around her \"all sex is rape\" than the soundbite that gets quoted, and those that have _definitely_ don't recommend Dworkin as a first read. (If you're hearing that concept without even hearing Dworkin's name around it... you're not actually hearing competent, well-studied, well-considered feminism.

However, custody is now a two-way street and old stereotypes no longer apply in a custody dispute.\n\nThis change is good not because \"men get more power\", but because *both* parents have the *same* rights.", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1442251551, "distinguished": null, "gilded": 0, "id": "cv1c59n", "link_id": "t3_3kv3fw", "nest_level": 4, "parent_id": "t1_cv0vc9i", "reply_delay": 43767, "retrieved_on": 1444358050, "score": 4, "subreddit": "AllWomen", "subreddit_id": "t5_3983i", "created": 1442273151.0}

The first wave of feminism began near the mid-19th century, and lasted until around the 1930's. This wave predominately focused of removing legal obstacles for women, by securing voting rights, property and inheritance rights, education rights, etc. Women also began organizing around birth control at the end of this wave. \n\nThe second wave of feminism began around the 1960's and lasted til the 80's. This is what is also known as the women's liberation movement, which sought further legal rights, such as the right to legal abortions and protections from workplace harassment, as well as to improve the social status of women, by challenging notions about women's place (remember up to this point women were thought to have belonged in the home as mothers and wives) and other sexist stereotypes about women. \n\nThe third wave of feminism is the contemporary wave, which began in the 1980's, and evolved as a direct criticism of certain prevalent aspects of the second wave, namely, the lack of inclusion for issues faced by women of color and non-gender binary persons (and sometimes even outright racism and transphobia). The theory of intersectionality is central to third wave feminism, and holds that our experiences of gender are shaped and influenced by our other identities, such as race/ethnicity, sexuality, class, ability, age, etc. Third wave feminism focuses on being an inclusive movement that better understands all structures of inequality so as to dismantle them. \n\nThe moral philosophy of feminism is naturalistic, meaning it believes that by virtue of our shared humanesss, all persons are naturally equal (socially and morally) and are endowed with the same human rights. It is therefore also described as egalitarian. There is also a large body of interdisciplinary feminist theory, which seeks to explicate structural inequality in its many and multifaceted forms. \n\nFinally, there is always an activist part of feminism, which is the \"human effort\" to change the conventions that create inequality. I believe that the activist part can be very individual and personal, though collective organizing and conscious-raising is necessary too for feminism. On the personal level, though, it starts with being critically aware of your thoughts, choices, actions, and speech. This means recognizing when you hold beliefs that stereotype others, or otherwise see them as anything other than an individual, or as unequal, and directly challenging that. It means thinking about the choices you make, to understand their historical and social origins, and to reflect on their consequences for you and others (and the earth). Since speech, and by extension, language, are essential to the way that we as individuals share our thoughts and beliefs with others, as well as how we come to understand our world, feminist theory and activism critically analyzes speech and language to understand how it can be used to reinforce inequality. Our actions are also important, for obvious reasons, though perhaps slightly less obvious is the idea that feminism is never passive. Feminist principles should always be upheld and practiced. It is also never enough for feminists to simply be not-sexist, or not-racist, or not-transphobic, etc; rather, feminists are proactive against inequality, as anti-sexist, anti-racist, anti-transphobic. \n\n", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1442237900, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1442359289, "gilded": 0, "id": "cv13z0h", "link_id": "t3_3kv3fw", "nest_level": 1, "parent_id": "t3_3kv3fw", "reply_delay": 37738, "retrieved_on": 1444353510, "score": 11, "subreddit": "AllWomen", "subreddit_id": "t5_3983i", "created": 1442259500.0}

There is a feminist majority in America? Is... is she joking? Our nation is *overrun* by reactionaries! Using the word \"Feminist\" almost pejoratively, ignoring completely that feminism has a multitude of meanings and has changed so dramatically in width and scope since the (lol) Victorian Era... this is rich. Don't get me wrong, I too feel that the United States has no business being in Afghanistan - but then that argument should have been made all the way back in 1980, and right to Charlie Wilson's ugly face. (Not to suggest that the Soviets had any business dropping cluster bombs on Afghanistan). \n\nAs an Indian myself, I find it particularly amusing that uses the example of sati. This is such a tricky subject to deal with and you never want to cross the line into that \"White Savior\" narrative, which is troubling, patronizing, and imperialistic. But at what point does warning against imperialistic patronization yield to sheer apology for abuse? The conditions faced by women (from Afghanistan to America to India to Britain) are oppressive and demeaning wherever you look. Indeed it is up to people within these societies to find their own narrative, their own way of finding a way to speak out against reactionary traditions and disrupt them. My experience in India has often been very disappointing - in the quest for denouncing imperialism, the narrative suddenly becomes nationalistic, reactionary, and downright fascistic - a wholesale denunciation of everything Western, to where the government prevents O.P. Nayyar from writing a saxophone melody for a film lest we Indians should fall prey to that \"vile Western propaganda and lecherous jazz music\" or where some two-cent politician in Kolkata suggests banning Shakespeare and replacing it with only Bengali literature or Bengali translations of selected \"safe\" works. Funny that she should mention clothing. In the patriarchal society that is India, the suggestion that a girl who was raped should not be shamed for the type of clothing she was wearing got quite a few frustrated head shakes and some isolated laughter and chuckling when I mentioned it at a family reunion in 2012. Back at the airport the security guard after the customs post was getting chummy with me, and then asked me if I had a white girlfriend in America, and if she's a firebrand in bed like Hollywood suggests they all are. When I came back I told a family friend that the harmonium (musical instrument which has become a staple of many Indian musical genres, especially Indian classical) she plays actually originates in France. She refused to believe me.\n\n**THAT BEING SAID, this article does hit on some great points**. One of the commenters said it best:\n&gt; Of course the people invoking the suffering of women and LGBT people to justify war in foreign lands are active members in pro-feminist and pro-LGBT rights groups in their own countries and are equally concerned about how women and non-heterosexuals are treated in their home communities. You'd be right to be skeptical. Politics shows similar trends. Politicians that have never supported women's or LGBT rights, or even actively worked against them, suddenly discover their inner egalitarian when promoting a war.\n\nIndeed many self proclaimed \"feminists\" in America tout a liberal-democratic perspective on world issues which ignores completely the complicity of American political intrigue, economic power play, and military browbeating in helping create conditions in the Middle East (and the rest of the entire world for that matter) that are hostile to women (as well as men), and LGBT, etc, and - for what its worth - *bankrolling the very same reactionary fundamentalist groups and individuals*  that they see fit to suddenly criticize.\n\nBut, more than anything else, the thing about articles such as this, to me, is they never seem to suggest any corrective course of action, because I still believe that oppression, worldwide, wherever you are is a real thing, whether its the exploitation of a woman's productive labor by some boss, or the exploitation of her reproductive labor. INDEED, in a power dynamic where one member or party has significantly less power than another, simply the presence of consent from the less powerful half cannot be enough to justify an action. Authors such as this one seem tenuously to focus on the presence of consent given by Afghan women to wearing the burqa as ultimate justification for said act - is that simply the end of the story?\n\n[Here's a great article about the presence of consent in a society where sex is a gendered act and power is skewed towards men](http://anti-imperialism.com/2015/07/06/lets-talk-about-consent/)\n\n[And, for comic relief, here's Gamal Abdel Nasser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TX4RK8bj2W0&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1s)\n", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1441825115, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1441825882, "gilded": 0, "id": "cuvw6r4", "link_id": "t3_3k7fpy", "nest_level": 1, "parent_id": "t3_3k7fpy", "reply_delay": 43872, "retrieved_on": 1444261700, "score": 3, "subreddit": "AllWomen", "subreddit_id": "t5_3983i", "created": 1441846715.0}

Again, I would analogize to celebrating July 4 as the day \"white, landowning men\" won their independence... it's a little awkward? Like, if I saw a bunch of people celebrating and I asked, 'why are you celebrating', and they said, 'This is the day that white, landowning men' won their right to political independence', I would be turned off. It's not that I think white, landowning men shouldn't *have* the right to their political independence, but that celebrating such an exclusionary group *feels* wrong. Similarly, I would feel that celebrating *white women* feels wrong because the exclusionary signifier 'white' existed due to the racism felt by POC. Does that make sense?\n\nI admit I have no solution to this issue, I'm just saying I understand why FB included pics of WOC in their picture- even though its historically inaccurate. Maybe it's a matter of WOC 'reappropriating' the day. July 1, 1971 is when the voting age was lowered to 18.

We need to celebrate these days but also identify the fact that only white women got the right the vote, and that women of colour were still struggling.

I think your friend is approaching these issues from the mindset of being a Nice Person. Let's say all three of us really like cake. We're walking down the street and suddenly someone hands us both a cake. Your friend doesn't get a cake. She's happy for us, though, because *we* got cake and since she's a Nice Person, she's just happy that cake exists for human consumption to begin with and we should celebrate together because we're all human. Since *she's* a Nice Person and is unperturbed at not receiving cake, *everyone else* should also be fine with not receiving cake because everyone should be Nice People.\n\nSardonic example aside, I see where your friend is coming from. It would be great if we lived in a world where every victory against oppression is celebrated as we march ever closer towards equality. However, in the real world, there is no progress without recognition and disruption. If no one calls out inequality because we're all trying to be Nice People, inequality will still persist. If the suffragettes had been content with celebrating the abolishment of property requirements for the right to vote and never said anything about the exclusion of women \u2013 because hey, women couldn't own property \u2013 women's suffrage never would have happened.\n\nOf course, I'm preaching to the choir here because we both agree. I think your friend has good intentions (she aims to be a nice person), but has a too idyllic view of the world that may partially come from her privilege. Most of the battles for her rights have already been fought, so she finds it alienating that other minority groups aren't happy with what's already been won.

I have learned many profound things because I was not willing to just say, 'this part is bullshit.'\n\nWith that said, though, I can remember back to being a young man and talking with a friend of mine, another young guy, while we were high on Robotussin, LOL, about Christianity. He was a Christian and I was not yet. I told him that there were a lot of things about Christianity that appealed to me, but that I was just appalled by an uncountable number of things in the bible.

I'll do my best to offer what I can, though. Now first, I'll say that I am a subscriber to the sub, but more of a lurker there. I identify myself as knowledgeable about Radical Christianity because I associate with individuals and groups that espouse similar ideas to those on the sub. As the sub states, Radical Christianity is about tying Christian faith to a very diverse range of philosophies, theologies, and political views. Now the term Radical Christianity has been commandeered at certain points by Evangelical groups in the past who wish to emphasize an iconoclastic element of their faith. That sort of evangelicalism is not the sort of thinking that is espoused on the sub or in the real life groups that I have associated with. These groups tend to have unusual views on doctrine and practice. That's what makes a Radical Christian.\n\nThat being said, I can only give my view as to why God allows people to suffer, and my doing so would not be in keeping with answering questions about Radical Christianity as a group. You might then be tempted to confuse my view with those of other members of the sub, particularly those with a lot more seniority and activity there than I have.\n\nAs to your questions about reconciliation of Radical Christians' practices and beliefs with a perceived misogyny in Christianity, I can only say that Radical Christians really aren't known for espousing such practices. Radical Christians are known more for being Christians who are communists or anarchists and the like. They are known for an eclectic internalization of philosophies. As such, practices and beliefs are going to be extremely divergent. Radical Christian groups, of which the sub is one, are hardly associated with certain Christian cultural practices of forcing women to wear bonnets or dresses or saying that it is unbiblical for a woman to get a job. Radical Christians are known to be very socially liberal, although some of them are socially liberal while ethically conservative or theologically conservative. Basically to be a radical Christian is to be an iconoclastic Christian. On the sub, very pronounced acceptance of LGBT or feminist groups and ideas is the norm. Condemnations against racism are the norm.\n\nI guess I would say that radical Christianity doesn't make any effort to reconcile anything with traditional Christianity.

Especially when we are dealing with subtle nuanced discrimination and levels of privilege that some people have over others, it becomes very hard to realize how the lived experience of others is fundamentally different than your own.  When viewed this way, it becomes easy to perceive any attempt to level the playing field as attempting to raise the group of lesser privilege above yourself.  Thus feminism is viewed as an attack on men who \"haven't done anything wrong\" by existing within the structure they are accustomed to.  Back in my highschool days, people would joke about the \"oppressed middle class white male\" in the sense that scholarships and other things were far easier to come by if female, poor, or a minority.  This seemed unfair to me at the time (silly me, still unknowingly pretending to be a guy), but it was because I had no exposure to the institutional bias that favored me and not the other groups.

It's just a criticism of the white-washed America and the, in her eyes, unhelpful Native response to that America. How, exactly, should we change the system? Do you want to merge Native egalitarian goals ideals with what is or revamp it into something completely different? How do you think Native communities *should* be responding?\n\nI also felt a little underwhelmed with her criticisms of American feminism. I think it's a little off base to say the suffragette movement co-opted Native feminism; I doubt most suffragettes were even aware of the struggles of Native women or what Native culture was like pre-colonialism, and I don't think oppressed people rising up to fight for their own rights are necessarily co-opting anything. Especially since she clearly feels that the ideas of Native feminism and American feminism are pretty different. BUT, I can understand where that feeling comes from, since the colonial, white, American culture swooped in and violently displaced the Native cultures, it's a really tricky subject to capture all the angles of, and seems like something that has no \"right\" way of looking at. I don't know anything about the history of pre-colonial feminism in America, though, so I could be way off base with this paragraph.\n\nAs far as revamping feminism with the Native population at its center, why should we focus on changing one ethnicity as the \"main\" group to another? Why can't we just continue growing intersectionalism so that there is no main ethnicity at the forefront of feminism, so that women of all ethnicities have their respective issues validated by everyone else? I don't think we're quite there yet, but I like to believe we're heading in the right direction.\n\nHonestly, I feel way too ignorant to really respond to this piece properly, but I felt it deserved discussion and, well, I read it so here are my thoughts.

My local GSM community's been pretty great at basically blacklisting folks in the community who are terrible, and I've seen a lot of cis gay dudes get excluded for such jackassery (they're given chances to do better and apologize, but a lot just take offense that they're being asked to).  I'd like to see that happen elsewhere, tbh.\n\nAnd yeah, a lot of hetero cis folk say them out of ignorance, but I've found a lot let those words bypass previous teachings from trans friends over teminology. Like, a good friend of mine came out as trans two years ago, and things were swimmingly with her friends until a few of them decided that 'trans woman' was too boring, and that the T and S words were better and more fun. I've dealt with similar issues with friends in the past, and it took weeks and weeks to get them to realize that no, those words are not to be used, yes we're serious, yes they're slurs, and no, drag queens aren't the same as trans women. We've both had friends who were quick to correct themselves, but we both dealt with a number who just had great difficulty believing we were serious when RuPaul and co (and/or local drag artists) used those words so often. A lot of the time, cis folk will be more keen to listen to other cis people on how to talk to and refer to trans people, and that's why my community has pushed so hard to get local drag stars on our side and educate, because folks tend to listen to them more than they listen to us, and if the drag folk are educating using our words, then...well, that's better than the alternative.

However, in the past few years in my city, after a lot of outreach and discussions, basically all the big-name drag performers here keep those words within their spaces, and even then it's largely limited to outside of their performances. It's not much of a win, but it HAS helped tone down the use of those slurs by drag performers and other cis folk. At least, I've noticed it, and others in my community have noticed the drop in those slurs in LGBT spaces, so it's a start.\n\nMy larger concern, given how stubborn drag queens are at letting go of that language, is their audience, and their friends, thinking it's okay to use those words because drag performers do. Again, maybe the queens in my area are just more reasonable than normal, but they've helped with education over the past few Pride weeks on that topic, informing people that they're slurs not meant for folks to use unless you're part of a select community, and even then, it should be limited (while me and other trans folks have done our workshops saying it's a slur that no one should use, but at least there's some progress happening).\n\nIt's not a perfect approach. I hate those words, and I don't like how drag performers can just throw the words around and walk away from them when they return to their real lives, leaving trans people as the sole visible targets of them. It's not right, it's not fair, but I'm hoping that just focusing on telling cis folk not to use them, and getting the drag community to slowly shift away from those words, will help eradicate their usage in common vocabularies. Because from my experience, it's not the drag queens throwing those slurs at me, it's everyday cis folk who think it's totally okay to call me those, so if we can get drag performers to help educate the masses that no, those words aren't acceptable, then I think that will make a bigger difference than railing against a super stubborn drag community.

Like, if you're a white person with black friends who use the N word, you shouldn't use that word yourself. That's for them. If you're straight and your gay friends call each other the f word, then you shouldn't do the same. And if you're cis and your drag queen friends use the T or S word, then you shouldn't use those words. \n\nAdditionally, there's the sociopolitical element in North America of white people  (and especially non-black gay men) being lauded (or at worst lightly teased) for appropriating AAVE, while black folks who use AAVE get discriminated against socially, in employment practices, at the workplace, in school, in the media, by police, etc. Same goes with white folks appropriating black culture or physical traits associated with blackness (see: Iggy Azalea, Kylie Jenner, etc.)...often acclaimed for doing so, while black people are often  discriminated for it. I could keep going, but I think I've made my point.\n\nAs for \"speaking for\" groups aside from your own, that's just not good practice. If you must do so, only elevate the words you've heard from members of that group...if you can't recall those words, don't speak of them, or for that group, at all. \n\nAnd no, one member of a social group cannot speak for the whole. However, they are most certainly in a position of authority on such matters, and their voice is more valuable on such matters than anyone outside of their group. Whether that's gay men discussing gay rights, sex workers discussing sex work politics, trans people discussing trans issues, etc. For instance, I'm a trans person. There is no cis person alive who knows more about being trans than I do. That's just a cold hard fact, and while there are trans people more knowledgeable than me on a plethora of trans-related topics, no cis person can add more value to such discussions than me. \n\nIt's important to recognize that members of social groups simply know better. So often, this is ignored, and it leads to people outside of marginalized groups attempting to use their privilege and the power of their voice to drown out criticism from minorities. Like, if a black person tells a white person they're being racist against black people, the white person should not challenge that criticism and get defensive...they should accept it, ask how to do better, and take the criticism to heart. Yet, so often, people instead just double down and deny, deny, deny, because they aren't affected by such issues, and can easily walk away. It's important to be mindful and respect those who know better.

It's still primarily a social construct, it still helps produce gender, and in turn is reproduced by gender, and it's still not stable in any sense of the word.\n\nIt would be cool if folks treated sex as a sort of spectrum, but alas, that's just not how society is set up currently, and we often have to use the language pressed upon us to describe our realities.\n\nSex, tbh, hardly ever becomes relevant in discussion. If I'm at the doctor, they have all my paperwork and know all about me, so sex just doesn't come up. I mean, sure, I'm a trans woman, but I'm hardly male...I have a prostate and a penis, and any health concerns related to those can be treated if necessary, but everything else more or less is dependant in my hormone levels, which are in the 'female-typical' range. IF I have to use sex within such a context, I use female, just like all my ID lists me as. It is what it is. In case of emergencies, I carry a card that more or less breaks down my health status and any unique factors, so I can be treated properly and avoid random medical staff from assigning me a potentially incorrect sex and making brazen assumptions from that. I think we need to get past this idea that there is such a thing as 'biological sex', and that it's somehow immutable. The reality is much more complex than that.\n\nAnd in any social sense of sex, I'm a female. Whether pre-transition, or post-transition, that's how I understood/understand myself. I have friends who don't understand themselves to be male or female, and I think that's perfectly acceptable of them to do so. When people try to make distinctions, at least within a social context, between sex and gender, it's honestly not very helpful. In a social context, male=man and female=woman, there are reasons why this conflation occurs, and a big part of it is because gender relies on 'sex' in order to be made visible and distinct. Secondary sex characteristics become the gateway for the gendering process, and in turn sex is infused with social norms and expectations as to what traits are for men/males, and what traits are for women/females. Gender, socially, cannot separate from sex. If gender was somehow abolished, sex would still hold such normative beliefs because sex was constructed through a gendered lens.

That's why it's on us, on people of color, to do our best to educate\u2014because we DO live with it 24/7, and we have a different perspective that they never will, whether they want it or not.  We don't get the luxury of a respite.  People of color, as shown by police raids in the past (exemplified by the Johnston killing), aren't even safe in their own homes.

I always ignore it\u2014if someone doesn't want people to get upset, then they always have the option of keeping their yaps closed and not asking insensitive questions.  If they want to feel like they can ask any question at all, they need to be prepared for the answers they're gonna get.  As you'll see in my response to OP, I pointed out that this was not the best place to ask a question like that.  I'm sure you've encountered that kind of gritted-teeth diplomacy before: \"not the best place\" means \"you have no idea how wrong you were to post this question here and I'm silently judging you for it.\"  Yes, I was put off by the post, too.  I did my best to address the issue/question itself; I'm not interested in trying to make people feel better about asking dumb questions, but I'm also trying to phrase information in a way that doesn't raise hackles\u2014information generally gets ignored when people feel like they're being attacked, and to me, the information is the important part.\n\nI'm sorry I came across as condescending.  I was aiming for \"diplomatic\" and \"practical,\" but clearly missed.  (I am not a diplomatic person by nature.)  Ultimately, what I don't want is for someone to come in, ask a question, and leave with a bunch of, \"I can't believe you just asked that.  Are you fucking kidding me?

I am an active member of the Gay Straight Alliance and in this coming school year I am going to join Speech and Debate. I was also a member of a fairly short-lived school club which aimed towards achieving visibility for women of color. I am generally a very socially anxious person, but having something to really speak about passionately has helped me with that. I have plenty of anti-feminist peers that have harassed me for my beliefs, but since we're all still very young most are more open to feminist ideas than adults. \n\n2. Privilege is more about, well, privilege than superiority. For example, a white woman is more privileged in society than a black woman because on average, she earns more money, is considered &amp; hired for more jobs, is less likely to be searched in an airport, is less likely to be arrested, etc. simply because of her race. \n\n3. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that you're asking if the feminism movement is becoming less accepted because it operates in contrast to other beliefs. The answer to that, in my opinion, is yes and no. I don't think that there will be any point in time where everyone will accept and embrace feminism because of their own beliefs, but I do think that feminism is a lot more accepted in the mainstream than it was 10 or even 5 years ago, and I hope that pattern continues. \n\n4. A very important thing to acknowledge in feminism is that women are not all treated the same in society and in the media because of other factors of identity that come into play. Like I said earlier, a white woman is going to be treated better than a black woman despite the fact that she's going to be treated worse than a white man, and I think that acknowledging that difference is going to earn us more supporters, particularly from people that are already actively against racism, ableism, homophobia, etc. \n\n5. Yes, there is definitely a spectrum of feminist belief. There are intersectional feminists, traditional feminists, reactionaries, first wave, second wave, third wave, white feminists, post-feminists, TERFs, etc. Some go as far as to incite an all-out war on men, some believe that women have all the same rights as men because they can vote, and most are somewhere in the middle. Feminists certainly do not all agree with each other on everything.

Embarrassing someone over a question you find insensitive makes them feel bad and also doesn't inform them of anything.  I can handle people feeling bad, but given the nature of this sub (respectful discussion, openness, civility), I think it's better to be polite and ignore questions that get your back up.  Your time is your own, and it's valuable, so it's worth thinking about whether or not you want to use (or waste, depending on how you look at things) it on writing a response to a question that's not sitting right with you.  Someone else will hopefully tackle it for you, or it'll be left for long enough that you have the opportunity to burn off some of the immediate anger towards the poster and let the anger about the injustice take over when you do write a response.\n\nThe other option is to educate.  Lay out the information in a way that encourages the person asking the question to take it in, process it, and understand it\u2014calling someone's question bad puts them on the defensive and shuts them down to discussion.

[The arrest video itself](http://wgntv.com/2015/07/25/new-dash-cam-video-shows-another-view-of-sandra-blands-arrest/) also brought up plenty of controversy, showing a cop pulling Sandra out of her car and pinning her to the ground for failing to use a turn signal, though she was not actually told by the officer at any point why she was being arrested. \n\nThere are many reasons to believe that she was dead in her mugshot.

It's also worth acknowledging that when you get a mugshot taken, it gets taken in the clothes you were arrested in, and they will tell you not to lean against the wall and look directly at the camera. \n\nThe police also claim that she hung herself from a 5-foot platform with a trash bag from the trash can in her cell. She was 6 feet tall, and trashcans are not allowed in cells because they can't be bolted to the floor. In the photo of the cell after her death, there is a trash bag in the trashcan that seems to have replaced the one she allegedly used, even though police say the scene was not tampered with before the photo (which would include a trash bag being replaced). Sandra told her sister on the phone that she thinks her shoulder is broken, which would have affected her ability to tie anything high enough to hang herself from.

So [deterritorialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterritorialization) comes out of french post-structuralism, specifically out of the work done by Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. How I understand it is that the plane of immannce is a smooth space that has been territorialized or striated by different groups - our concepts are striations. These territorializations (which include things like hierarchies or binaries) become accepted as truth. So, for instance, when it comes to gender concepts, the binary of male and female is not something innate, but has been territorialized and created. So, the gender binary has been created as a territory upon a smooth space. \n\nNow, territories are deterritorialized through becoming. This is a really complicated thing to try and explain (and if you are really interested in this concept, I can point you in the right direction), but I think that the way I come at it is that we should question anything that has been put forward as truth. We should question the truth of the gender binary. By questioning the binary, we can open the door to new ways of understanding. We can deterritorialize that striation. By questioning the thing that has been put forward as truth, we can begin to undermine that concept. \n\nTL;DR: We question the concept of the gender binary in order to undermine and subvert that concept, which has been understood as true.

This, to me, is the most important part: other people being bad examples of any group\u2014men, women, transgender people, Ravens fans, students at Harvard, rich as fuck people, people barely making ends meet, feminists, whatever\u2014shouldn't change how you see yourself.  Do you believe in equality for all people?  Kerbango, you're a feminist.  You may be very different from people you see as bad feminists, but that shouldn't change what you believe in or how you treat others.\n\nThat being said, I'm angry that you've encountered people who would look down on you and yours or exclude you from their definition of feminism.  I haven't thought about whether or not polyamory has a place in feminism myself because I don't really see one depending on the other.  It'd be kind of like asking me if carrots have a place in feminism. :)  I mean, sure... if they want it, I wouldn't oppose them.  I like carrots, I think well of them.  Carrots are valuable to society, just like the other vegetables, and I wouldn't treat them any differently.    They do well under conditions that aren't like the ones I prefer, but what difference should that make when the resulting carrot is just as upstanding and respectable as I am?  Different roads, same destination.\n\nPersonally, I think polyamory has the potential to be wonderful.  There's enough insecurity and jealousy in me that I couldn't do it myself, but the idea of there being more love in a house than less, just from the number of people, is beautiful.  When I was debating with someone about whether gay people should have equal marriage rights, he (a conservative Christian) said, \"But what about their children?\"  So I told him that I thought the children of a gay couple would be more likely to be loved and have their needs met because the parents would have to work damn hard to have one.  \"What next\", he asked me, \"bigamy?\"  And I was like, \"Well, why not?  Would it be such a terrible thing for more than two people to love and look out for each other in one house, to have more people involved in helping a household run, raising kids that are loved by more than just two parents, and all that?  What happened to 'it takes a village to raise a child'?  Wouldn't it be a great thing to have a village in your home, one where everyone has a parental investment in the kids?\"\n\nA lot of people tend to get hung up on things they simply don't understand, like if they couldn't handle being in a poly relationship, then no one could do it.  It's a pretty myopic view, don't you think?  They neglect the heart of what they're looking at and focus on the superficial shit.  I have no idea what it would be like to be poly, but at the core of it is love.  How could I possibly see that as something bad or unnatural?  I know I'm just one person; my opinion may not mean very much.  However, neither should the opinions of those who shower you, your gf, and the others in your relationship with negativity.", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1437978942, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1437986124, "gilded": 0, "id": "cthikos", "link_id": "t3_3eqiqd", "nest_level": 1, "parent_id": "t3_3eqiqd", "reply_delay": 7193, "retrieved_on": 1440108898, "score": 7, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "AllWomen", "subreddit_id": "t5_3983i", "created": 1438000542.0}

This growth has only increased in speed as we men begin to relate to all people as social equals through the benefit of telecommunication technology that gives us experience beyond what our forebears could have had. \n\nIf you'd like to know more, here is my best work on the obligations of the male feminist in the mainstream movement.

My next work will introduce more of that conversation. Privilege blinds us all, especially in our youth and surrounded by long-established systems of domination and power.

I was pretty angry earlier just because I genuinely didn't understand where you were coming from so I am sorry for that because that's not fair to you. You're not ableist or heterosexist. (Not that you need me to tell you that) No, intersectionality is not basic, and it's not easy, and that in and of itself is the point of intersectional feminism. I'm not a champion. I'm not a gatekeeper. I'm not some kind of \"white savior\" and I'd never want to be. I'm also not racist, and I know you beg to differ, which is fine, but here's how I see it:\n\nIt is true that in the late 60's and 70's, the concept of intersectionality was brought up by women of color and focused around women of color and had nothing to do with anything else. It *was* about race. And then, the issue of class came up in regards to capitalism. And then, sexuality. And then, ableism. And then everything else that we talk about today, until the first academic text in 1989 included ability, class, sexuality, religion, even *species* in the definition of intersectional feminism.\n\nI, and I personally, really don't think that this was a whitewashed definition. The original concept in the 60's was that women do not experience life in the same way and can't be accurately represented as a whole. I don't think that distinguishing the experiences of women through race alone would be accurate or true to the original concept. Not all black women share the same experience, not all Latina women share the same experience, etc. because they still vary among each other as far as oppression goes and I wouldn't personally feel right to ignore that fact. I'm not trying to say that all women are the same and all need the same things to happen in society in order to be equal. In fact, I am saying the exact opposite of that, which isn't trying to simplify but rather is trying to take your view of intersectional feminism and make it more complex. A white woman and a black woman see the world in different ways from each other, but so do a cis black woman and a trans black woman, and that's why I feel the need to broaden the scope on intersectionality and acknowledge all differences among women rather than just a small part. (Eg. race)\n\nI rarely see people use your definition of intersectionality anymore and I'm sorry for that, but I believe that you can make something more inclusive to others without demeaning the ones that were there first. \n\nThat's how I define intersectionality for myself, and that's the context in which I'm going to use it.
